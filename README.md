- I am a long time software developer experienced in C, C++, Java, Groovy and Gosu languages.  I have worked extensively with the Spring Framework (started using back around 2004 yes it was around then and I see newer projects all the time that don't use it why?).  Also have a wealth of SQL experience in SQL Server, MySQL and Postgresql.  
- I am currently working on
- - Subscription project using Vue.js, Firebase and Shopify.
- - Cannabis certification project using Java, SQL Server (and a very clunky data model), Docker, Azure.
- - Timetracking system built in Java with a never before imagined web framework.
- - Adoption Agency system using good old Groovy and Grails (has a very good codebase - props to the originators).
- - Guidewire BillingCenter 10 implementation.
- I am experimenting with
- - Microservices - learning the best way to build and secure them.
- - React - as I have time I am getting more familiar with.
